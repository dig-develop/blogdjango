# Blog with Django

A simple blog built with Django to practice backend development. As a frontend developer at heart, I integrated custom templates.

## Features
- Post creation and listing.
- Authentication via Django admin.
- Responsive and minimalist interface.

## How start
1. Clone this repository
2. `python -m venv env && env/bin/Activate.ps1` Obs:: Check OS, I used Windows. If u receive error on windows, try to run commands separaly
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python manage.py migrate`
5. `python manage.py createsuperuser`
6. `python manage.py runserver`

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Django 4.x
- Frontend: HTML/CSS pure
- Banco: SQLite Obs:: remember in production to use another database of your preference

Thanks!
